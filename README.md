# Team-Profile-Manager

## Description

This application creates cards on an HTML page that contain info about a project team. The user can run the application via terminal which then will be prompted to ask a series of questions about each team member. The info will be neatly organized and displayed on an HTML page created within the app's /dist folder.

## Usage

Clone the repository or downlad the zip file to your local files. Navigate to the file through a console and enter "npm i".

After the dependencies are installed, type "node index.js" in the console and it will begin the series of questions.
